//! # RPC-IT

//! Low-level RPC abstraction
//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! There are three concepts for RPC handling:
//!
//! - Send Notify
//! - Send Request => Recv Response
//! - Recv Request
//!
//! This library is modeled after the `msgpack-rpc`, but in general, most RPC protocols follow
//! similar patterns, we may adopt this to other protocols in the future. (JSON-RPC, etc...)
